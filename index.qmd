# Assignment

1. Implementation of the algorithms in Julia
2. Experiments for comparison of the algorithms
3. SHAPE-Trust characteristics

# EigenTrust

- aggregation of opinions
- stationary distribution / eigenvector ($\lambda = 1$)

$$ t_{ik} = \sum_{j} c_{ij}c_{jk} $$
$$ \vec{t} = (C^T)^2\vec{c_i} \dots \vec{t} = (C^T)^n\vec{c_i} $$

# MaxTrust

- Max-Plus algebra
  
$$ (+, \cdot ) \to (\oplus, \otimes) = (max, +) $$

- Eigenmode

$$ A \otimes (\eta^{\otimes^k} \otimes v) = \eta \otimes (\eta^{\otimes^k} \otimes v) $$ 

# SHAPE-Trust

- Coalitional game theory
- Shapley value

$$ v_{\mathcal{G}}(S) = \sum_{\substack{i,j\in S \\ (i,j)\in E}} c_{ij} \space + \space \sum_{j \in S^*} \underset{\substack{i\notin S \\ (i,j)\in E}}{\min} c_{ij}, \hspace{2cm} S \subseteq N$$

# Conclusion

This thesis:

  - Implemented all algorithms in Julia 
  - Compared all algorithms on specific instances
  
Future research:

  - Experiments with real data


# Thank You For Your Attention {.thanks}

# Reviewer's Question 1 {.thanks}

Figure 1.5: Algorithm 2: There is a parameter “a” in the algorithm, which represents the convex combination of
two vectors. What value is chosen for “a” in the thesis?

# Reviewer's Question 2 {.thanks}

Do you have any idea about the difference between time complexity of both methods?

# Reviewer's Question 3 {.thanks}

Table 4.2: According to the graph in Figure 4.5, peer-2 and peer-4 are assigned the same value 0.0, although the
author presents the ordering as 3. And 4., respectively. Such an ordering supports the claim that “all algorithms
rated the peers appropriately”. My question is why did the author choose this ordering, despite the values being
the same?
